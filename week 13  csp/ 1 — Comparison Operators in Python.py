# Objective:
# Students will learn how to compare values using Python’s comparison operators and interpret Boolean results.

# Topics Covered:
# ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=

# Key Notes:

# Comparison operators compare two values and return either True or False.

# Remember: = is assignment, while == is comparison.

a = 3
b = 4

print(a == b) #Checks for equality  # False
print(a != b) #Checks if is not equal  # True
print(a > b)  #Checks for greater than   # False
print(a < b)  #Checks for less than  # True
print(a >= b) #Checks for greater than or equal to  # False
print(a <= b) #Checks for less than or equal to  # True


#predict the output of the following comparisons:
10 > 5  #True
7 == 2 * 3 + 1 #True
8 != 8 #False
4 <= 2 + 2 #True
print("!")
# Write 3 examples that result in True and 3 that result in False.
print(30==30)
print (4+7>=2+5)
print(12!=9)
print(6==2)
print (4!=4)
print (9+5<=2+4)
# Create a simple grade-checking condition:

# practice problem :
# where a student must check if their score is greater than or equal to 60 to pass a test.# The password must be at least 8 characters long and contain at least one digit.password = "mypassword1"
score=int(input("What is your score?"))

if score>=60:
    print ("You passed!")
else:
    print("You failed!")

grade=int(input("What is your grade"))
if grade>=90 and grade<=100:
    print("You got an A")
elif grade>=80 and grade<=89:
    print("You got a B")
elif grade>=70 and grade<=79:
    print("You got a C")
elif grade>=60 and grade<=69:
    print ("You got a D")
else:
    print("You got an F, see me in ACLAB")

password=input("What is your password?")
print(password)
if len(password) >= 8 and any(char.isdigit() for char in password):
    print("Password is valid.")
else:
    print("Password is not valid, it should be at least 8 characters long and contain at least one digit.")
